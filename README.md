# Welcome to my Tweet app program!

## It has been deployed here: https://tweet-frontend.onrender.com/

This JavaScript program is a small X (formerly-known as Twitter) clone that will display all 'Tweets' on the dashboard. Once logged in, the user will be able to post a 'Tweet' to the public wall.

The back-end part of the application was built using Express. I have used Mocha and Chai/Chai-http for testing and C8 for coverage. <br>
I have chosen MongoDB Atlas for my database and Mongoose to connect my Express app to the database. <br>
The front-end part of the application was built using Vite and React. Vitest is used for testing, and V8 for Coverage.

- The username and email are unique.
- Peeps (posts to chitter) have the name of the trainee and their user handle.

## How to use

You can fork this repository and clone it to your local machine.

You will need to type:<br>
`npm install` (or `npm i` for Mac users) to install all dependencies.

=> For the back-end program:<br>
`npm start` to start the server.<br>
`npm test` to run the tests - the command includes a coverage report.

=> For the front-end program:<br>
`npm run dev` so that Vite gives you a localhost access to the application. <br>
`npm test`to run the tests. <br>
`npm run coverage` to get a coverage report.

Feel free to contribute and publish a few 'tweets'!
